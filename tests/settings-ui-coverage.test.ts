/**
 * Settings-page coverage guard.
 *
 * The host whitelists a switch, the README promises it is editable in the page,
 * and the page... forgets a widget. That is exactly how `adminPolicy` stayed
 * uneditable for two releases while being the load-bearing switch for remote
 * workspace access: `POLICY_CHOICES` was defined in the client and never
 * rendered, so the only way to leave the default `local_only` was to hand-edit
 * the profile patch (reported 2026-09-26).
 *
 * This test reads the client source and asserts every switch the host accepts
 * at runtime has a write call in the page. It is deliberately a source-level
 * check: rendering the React tree needs a DOM and a React copy this package
 * does not ship, and the failure it guards against is "the control is absent",
 * not "the control is drawn wrong".
 *
 * The stylesheet half of this file guards the OTHER thing a later edit can
 * silently undo: the section is drawn in DSH's official design language, with
 * the official controls, and not with a bespoke material of its own (the
 * "Liquid Glass" skin this page used to carry).
