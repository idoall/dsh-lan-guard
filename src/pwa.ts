/**
 * dsh-lan-guard — the installability service worker, and why it has to exist.
 *
 * Chromium (and Edge on Android) will not offer "install as an app" for an
 * origin that has a valid manifest but no service worker with a `fetch`
 * handler: the browser then only offers "create shortcut", which opens in an
 * ordinary tab instead of a standalone window. DSH ships a manifest
 * (`/manifest.webmanifest`) and registers no service worker anywhere, so on a
 * phone the install entry comes back greyed out — the state the Android menu
 * reports as 「无法安装此应用」.
 *
 * This worker is deliberately EMPTY of behaviour: its `fetch` listener never
 * calls `respondWith`, so every request is answered by the browser's own
 * network stack, byte for byte, with the credentials and the streaming the gate
 * already relies on. It exists to satisfy the installability check, not to
 * intercept anything — a caching worker here would sit between a visitor and an
 * authenticated, cookie-carrying, streaming application.
 *
 * Two details are load-bearing:
 *
 * - it is served from the gate's own path prefix, so the response carries
 *   `Service-Worker-Allowed: /`. Without that header the worker's scope would
 *   default to its own directory, it would never control the page, and the
 *   install check would still fail;
 * - `navigator.serviceWorker` exists only in a SECURE CONTEXT, so an operator
 *   serving the gateway over plain HTTP gets no worker at all. The registration
 *   is a silent no-op there instead of an error.

/** Marker attribute naming the injected registration script, for tests and de-duplication. */
/*
 * MARKER STYLE IS LOAD-BEARING: these markers sit INSIDE a script element, and
 * the HTML-comment opener is a legal SINGLE-LINE comment in JavaScript (Annex
 * B). A marker written that way therefore comments out the rest of the injected
 * line — which is the whole script, since each is emitted on one line.
 *
 * All three patches below shipped with that marker and silently did nothing:
 * the document-language fix and the service-worker registration never ran
 * (found 2026-10-04, by noticing that a new patch's side effect never happened
 * while its siblings' did). The patches that use a JS block comment were
 * unaffected, which is what hid this for so long.
 *
 * tests/pwa-scripts.test.ts now EXECUTES each script and asserts its effect,
 * instead of grepping for the marker text.

/**
 * The plugin-owned manifest and its icons.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: DSH's own `/manifest.webmanifest` declares a single icon,
 * `favicon.svg` with `sizes: "any"`. Chrome's documented install criteria
 * require "a 192px and a 512px icon", and an SVG-only manifest does not satisfy
 * that on Android — Edge offers only "create a shortcut" and reports "cannot
 * install this app" (reported 2026-10-04). Everything else about DSH's manifest
 * already qualifies, so this manifest mirrors it field for field and only
 * replaces the icon list with real PNGs rasterized from DSH's own favicon.
 *
 * It is served by the GATE, so the swap below is applied only on a page that
 * came through the gate: DSH's own loopback origin keeps DSH's own manifest.

 * 2. `start_url` and `scope` are ABSOLUTE. DSH writes `"./"`, which is correct
 *    only because its manifest sits at the origin root. This one sits at
 *    `/__dsh_lan_guard__/manifest.webmanifest`, and a relative value resolves
